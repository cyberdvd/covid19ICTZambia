ZAMBIA TECHNICAL RESPONSE TO COVID-19: Data Presentation Workstream
1.  Problem statements
 
(a)   Develop simple dashboard that brings together known information about COVID-19 in Zambia verified through the authorities. This can include geographical distribution, cases, number of tests done, count of positive cases, number of recoveries, trends, etc
(b)   Create an easy-to-use self-reporting portal, Mobile App and USSD application. This should be available to the public to report symptoms which can be reviewed by AI and monitoring team to decide on which cases to follow up for testing
(c)    Develop a Health Information BOT that can be used to disseminate factual data from authorities such as WHO, National response teams, etc
(d)   Create database for ZNPHI for data aggregation and an API to allow third parties to integrate to ensure publication of verified data in other tools and dashboards
(e)   Create a portal as a fact-check site to debunk fake news and myths
 
2.  Approach
(a)   Obtain compute resources on cloud infrastructure to be used for development (Options include Google Cloud, AWS, ZNDC, etc)
(b)  Brainstorm and agree on specifications for each of the applications to be developed
(c)   Set a priority list and order of App development
(d)  Identify specialists in specific areas of the project and assign tasks and timelines
(e)   Agree on governance/collaboration process
(f)    Advise of specific resources and environment needed for development
(g)   Roll sleeves and get to work!
3.  Possible Data Sources
(a)   Data from the ZNPHI 
(b)   Google Map
(c)    GitHub Open Collaboration (https://github.blog/2020-03-23-open-collaboration-on-covid-19/)
(d)   MNO Data (MSC Switching Records) i.e for mapping geographical distribution of possible Covid-19 infection hotspots etc.
4.  Required Resources and Prerequisites
 
(a)   System Administrator to prepare work environment for developers
(b)   Backend/server-end Developers
(c)    Frontend developers and visualisation experts
(d)   Public Health experts
(e)   Compute resources (Google Cloud, AWS or ZNDC) 
(f)    Buy-in from ZICTA, Smart Zambia Institute, Ministry of Health and Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)
(g)   ADD more here
5.  Immediate actions
·      Engage ZICTA Director General, Smart Zambia Coordinator, Director of Communication at Ministry of Communication, Ministry of Health and ZNPHI to get buy-in on the project
·      Solicit for compute power from ZNDC CEO -Done. Team should specify the actual resources required so that a formal request can be mabe
·      Recruit developers to execute (Can Bongo Hive be asked to partner)
·      Have members join the Slack Workspace set up for this purpose (zambiatechnol-nur3729.slack.com 
·      Carry out research on similar responses to help cut downtime to deployment
